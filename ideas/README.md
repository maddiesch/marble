Most of these are probably terrible :D

- Adding a suffix operator `?` will coerce the preceding value into a boolean.

  Example `fn() { 1 }()?` would return `true`

- Type coercion syntax: `true as Integer` would result in `1`

  `true is Bool` would return `true` & `1.1 is Integer` would return `false`
